"""Export a block's Anki deck out of the live collection and into the repo.

Purpose: publish one block's cards as a downloadable .apkg, plus the manifest
         the block page renders its Anki tab from, so what is on the site and
         what is in the collection cannot drift.
Author:  Noor Sims
Date:    2026-09-25
Input:   a running Anki with AnkiConnect on 127.0.0.1:8765, and a deck name
Output:  <course>/anki/<block>.apkg and <course>/data/anki/<block>.json

Run from the repo root, with Anki open:

    python3 tools/build_anki.py pom2 endo "PoM2::Block 1"

A fourth argument marks the deck as a draft, and the Anki tab shows it as a
warning above the download - for a deck filed by lecture but not yet brought
up to date against this year's slides:

    python3 tools/build_anki.py pom2 msk "PoM2::Block 3" "Built from ..."

Scheduling is stripped on the way out. The due dates in the collection are one
person's review history; what is published is the cards, and whoever imports
them starts their own. Re-running overwrites both outputs, which is the point -
the deck on the site is whatever the collection said the last time this ran.
