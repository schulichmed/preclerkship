"""What every course in the pre-clerkship portal shares.

Purpose: hold the course roster, the block-page template and the cache-busting
         helpers in one place, so four courses cannot drift into four dialects.
Author:  Noor Sims
Date:    2026-09-21

The portal is one site per year of pre-clerkship, all served from one origin and
all drawing on one engine (base.css, portal.css, quiz.js, notes.js, portal.js at
the repo root). A course is a directory, a block list and a set of question-set
families; everything else about it is data under its own directory.

Two of the four courses have no content yet. They are listed anyway, because the
portal's whole habit is to show the gap rather than hide it - a lecture with no
note still renders greyed, and a course with no blocks says so on the hub.
