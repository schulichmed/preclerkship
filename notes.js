/* The notes half of a PoM 2 block page.

   data/notes/<slug>.json carries the block's whole lecture roster, taken from
   the vault folders, not only the lectures that have a note. A lecture with
   "hasNote": false renders as a dashed gap, so this view doubles as a map of
   what is still left to write - the same reasoning that keeps an empty question
   set visible on the other tab.

   The rail carries an index of every lecture in the block. A block runs to 36
   notes of a page or more each, so the week chips narrow the stream but cannot
   get you to a named lecture; the index is the way in, and it marks the note
   you are reading as you scroll.

   Any note can be sent to PDF on its own, or a whole week at once, so it can be
   annotated by hand afterwards. That runs through the browser's own print
   dialogue: the page marks what should survive, prints, and unmarks.

   Mermaid is only fetched if some lecture in this block actually has a pathway,
   and any pathway can be opened full size in its own tab - inside the stream a
   wide diagram is squeezed into the column and its labels shrink with it. */
